    <h1>Rustafied AU Long Recap</h1>
    <h2>Early Game Review</h2>
    <p>The map this wipe played a huge part in our build location. Which sent us to the snow. Out of our element we tried to no avail.
        We were contested heavily and our progression was very very slow. A few key things: </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Our team did not work as a team (a few people doing their own thing)</li>
            <li>No objective</li>
            <li>No T3 after 24 hours of continous gameplay</li>
            <li>Not a single gun in base</li>
            <li> people using scrap to ensure THEY have blueprints rather than progressing the team</li>
            <li>People logging in after all the hard work is done and just using everything</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>After the struggle</h2>
    <p>Once we had established ourselves and we had materials and comps it was smooth sailing.</p>
    <p>We had one monument to ensure our foothold on the server....</p>
    <h2>GIANT EXCAVATOR!</h2>
